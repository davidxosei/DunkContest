Dunk Contest Simulation
This repository contains an interactive simulation of a Dunk Contest implemented in Java. The project aims to replicate the excitement and dynamics of the renowned dunk competition, allowing users to experience various difficulty levels, execute dunks, and receive scores from judges.

Features
Player Interactions: Users can participate as a human player or face off against computer-generated players.
Dunk Difficulty Levels: Offers easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels with distinct dunk challenges.
Judge Evaluation: Incorporates three judging styles (Lenient, Fair, Strict) with varying scoring criteria.
Design Patterns Used: Demonstrates the implementation of Strategy, Factory Method, and Singleton design patterns.
Scoring System: Utilizes complex scoring logic based on dunk difficulty and player attempts.
